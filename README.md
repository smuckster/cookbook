# cookbook
A recipe storage web application that allows you to enter, search for, browse, tag, edit, and delete recipes. 
Check out my personal instance (that I use regularly) at https://cookbook.gq.

What can this project do?
* Create and edit recipes with an easy-to-use recipe editor interface.
* Add public and private tags to recipes to categorize them.
* Browse and search for recipes by keyword.
* Comment on your own recipes or the recipes of other users.
* User authentication and management
